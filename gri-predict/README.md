Explanation
=====================
Dear reviewer from Coursera! 

PLEASE, visit (http://sanic1.github.io/DataProducts_Deck) to check the real Slidify presentation, 
based on the code from *gri-predict/* directory.

Unfortunately, at the moment of submitting I didn't understand, why there were problems with GitHub Pages, but now I've created apart repo 
(https://github.com/sanic1/DataProducts_Deck) with the same code, but set up it correctly. 
That is why the link above with presentation works correctly at the moment.

Sorry for inconvinience. And THANK YOU, that you saw this file and actually read it. 
Best wishes!
